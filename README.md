##  Overview
This project uses deep learning and computer vision to detect if a person is wearing a face mask in real time via webcam.

##  Tools
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- OpenCV, Haar Cascades
- Jupyter, Flask (optional)

##  Features
- Real-time webcam detection
- CNN model with MobileNetV2
- Visual alert for "No Mask"

##  How to Run
1. Train model: `python train_mask_detector.py`
2. Real-time detection: `python detect_mask_video.py`
